## Introduction
One of the primary job responsibilities of Cloud Solution Architects (CSA) is to help customers optimize their Azure spend and workloads.
While there are many tools available to help with this, they are often spread out across multiple domains, and some are documented more as "tribal knowledge" than sharable guidelines.

The goal of this documentation is to provide CSAs with a repository to not only learn cost optimization ideas and best practices, but in addition serve as a place for them to add ones of their own.
If you want to assist or have ideas to contribute, please contact [Gary Mullen-Schultz](mailto:gamullen@microsoft.com).

### Azure Advisor
[Azure Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) is a great first place to look for "low-hanging fruit" ideas on cost savings. Advisor also provides other valuable guidance for Azure usage, including:
* Security
* High Availability
* Operational Excellence
* Performance

We recommend this as your best first starting point for cost optimization analysis.
